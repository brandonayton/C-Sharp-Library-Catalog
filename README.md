# Overview

I created a Library Catalog System to expand my programming skills and learn C#. This project helped me understand how to build practical applications that manage data and handle user interactions.

The software is a console application that lets users manage a book collection. You can add new books, search for books by title or author, borrow and return books, and save all the data to a file so it remembers everything between uses. The program keeps track of which books are available and which are checked out.

My goal was to learn how C# handles object-oriented programming and file operations. I wanted to create something useful that demonstrates real-world programming concepts like classes, collections, and data persistence.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio 2022 as my main development environment, which provided great tools for writing and debugging C# code. 

The program is written entirely in C# using the .NET 8 framework. I used several built-in libraries including System for basic functions, System.Collections.Generic for lists, System.IO for file handling, and System.Linq for searching through data.

# Future Work

- Add a graphical user interface instead of just console text
- Create multiple user accounts with login system
- Add due dates and late fee calculations for borrowed books
- Connect to a real database instead of just text files
